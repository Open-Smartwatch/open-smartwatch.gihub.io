The Open-SmartWatch is an open source project created by [@pauls_3d_things](https://www.instagram.com/pauls_3d_things/)/[p3dt.net](https://p3dt.net).
It consists of hardware modules, 3D printable cases and a custom operating system to build smartwatches with the goal that they can be assembled, repaired, and modified by everyone. There are currently two versions:

* [Light edition](watches/light-edition.md) (released)
* [GPS edition](watches/gps-edition.md) (preview, work in progress)

Check out the apps to see what the watch can do!

* [Watchfaces](oswapps/watchfaces.md)
* [Tools](oswapps/tools.md)
* [Games](oswapps/games.md)

See the following pages for:

* [Hardware](resources/hardware.md): for ordering PCBs, or assembled watches
* [Firmware](resources/firmware.md): for infos on flashing the latest firmware
* [3D-Files](resources/3d-files.md): for 3D-printable design files
* [Open-Smartwatch-OS](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-os): the source code on GitHub. The main branch should be stable, the develop branch is usualy more up to date and can be unstable.
