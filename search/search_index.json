Version Links Description Known Problems 5.0 GPS Edition - - 4.0 Light Edition - - 3.3 Light Edition Same as v3.2, just added antenna cutouts See v3.2 3.2 Light Edition First official light release! Power delivery is too weak (300mA instead of 500mA), this results in crashes during WiFi usage. 3.1 GPS Edition Fix page metadata Unknown 3.0 GPS Edition First official GPS release!
